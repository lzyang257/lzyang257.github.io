	<summary>Fiber of the cyclotomic trace of the sphere spectrum and K-theoretic Tate-Poitou duality at the prime 2</summary>
	<p class="abstract"><i>Abstract:</i> Understanding the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum has long been recognized as a fundamental problem in algebraic and differential topology. Since the homotopy fiber of its p-completed cyclotomic trace depends only on the zeroth homotopy group, we can apply algebraic methods to study it. Blumberg and Mandell’s work demonstrates that, for odd primes, Tate-Poitou duality can be enhanced to an Anderson duality between the homotopy fiber and the K(1)-local K-theory of the integers. In this talk, I will present this connection and extend the result to the case where p=2.</p>

	<summary>The local equivariant degree and counting rational curves equivariantly</summary>
	<p class="abstract"><i>Abstract:</i> I will talk about joint work with Kirsten Wickelgren on defining a global and local degree in stable equivariant homotopy theory. We construct the degree of a proper $G$-map between smooth $G$-manifolds and show a local to global property holds. This allows one to use the degree to compute topological invariants, such as the equivariant Euler characteristic and Euler number. I will discuss the construction of the equivariant degree and local degree, and I will give an application to counting orbits of rational plane cubics through 8 general points invariant under a finite group action on $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$. This gives the first equivariantly enriched rational curve count, valued in the representation ring and Burnside ring. This equivariantly enriched count also recovers a Welchinger invariant in the case when $\mathbb{Z}/2$ acts on $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$ by conjugation.</p>

	<summary>Diffeomorphisms of reducible 3-manifolds</summary>
	<p class="abstract"><i>Abstract:</i> I will talk about joint work with Corey Bregman and Jan Steinebrunner, in which we study the moduli space B Diff(M), for M a compact, connected, reducible 3-manifold. We prove that when M is orientable and has non-empty boundary, B Diff(M rel ∂M) has the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex. This was conjectured by Kontsevich and previously proved in the case where M is irreducible by Hatcher and McCullough.</p>

	<summary>Genuine Involutions and Schemes</summary>
	<p class="abstract"><i>Abstract:</i> We develop a theory of schemes which come equipped with genuine involutions and develop invariants analogous to Picard and Brauer invariants for classical schemes. A key component of these invariants are Poincare structures on compact module categories. This is joint work with Noah Riggenbach and Lucy Yang.</p>
