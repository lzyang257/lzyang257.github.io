I am a Ph.D. student in homotopy theory. I also like to think about trace methods in K-theory and Grothendieck-Witt theory and categorical dynamics. I am on the job market Fall 2022. 

My advisor is <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/">Michael Hopkins</a>.

A copy of my CV (last updated Sept 20, 2022) can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/LYang%20curriculum%20vitae.pdf).
