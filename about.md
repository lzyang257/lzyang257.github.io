I am a Ritt Assistant Professor in the math department at Columbia University. 
My research interests lie in derived algebraic geometry and homotopy theory. 
Recently, I have been interested in involutions in derived algebraic geometry, Grothendieck--Witt theory via Poincar√© motives and real trace methods, and categorical dynamics. 

<!--In Fall 2023, I am teaching Math 1102: Calculus II.
